# Hi, I'm Simon Yates! 👋

As a Quantum Consultant, I help quantum companies scale and grow by finding and connecting them with like-minded individuals who share their vision and passion. I enjoy working with innovative and cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to transform the world.

I have a strong background in computer science, with a bachelor's degree from the University of Plymouth and a master's degree from the University of Exeter, where I focused on advanced topics such as deep learning, security, and quantum computing. I have developed multiple skills in cloud computing, web development, and cybersecurity, which I apply to my current role and projects. I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself in the field of technology.
